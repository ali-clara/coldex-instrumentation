# Example setup for an automation routine. I suggest setting them all up this way - 
# a class to manage the routine itself with a single entry point (run_routine). These script
# MUST have a function called run() in order for the GUI to understand them. 
# 
# Another thing to note is that I've set up run() to take an arbitrary input: run(**kwargs)
# It looks like magic, but it just means "keyworded argument". Whatever we give the function gets
# turned into a dictionary with the key-value pairs we specified. This lets us stay a little more
# flexible and backwards compatible - if I add a new script with an input we haven't used for
# old scripts, the old scripts can just ignore the new input. Doesn't work in reverse - we can't stop
# using established inputs willy nilly - but such is life.
